#Generative Painting

Generative Painting is a way of algorithmically creating compositions for my acrylic paintings. This branch specifically is designed to look at the paths of vectors pulled from a database of shapes. It then places this path randomly (within limits) on the canvas. This then repeats though all the paths of all the shapes. Colors are randomly generated (maximum of which can be defined).
