Perlin_Lines
======
Line generation based on Perlin Noise. Algorithmically generated per incarnation.

SVG_Generative
======
Generative Painting is a way of algorithmically creating compositions for my acrylic paintings. This branch specifically is designed to look at the paths of vectors pulled from a database of shapes. It then places this path randomly (within limits) on the canvas. This then repeats though all the paths of all the shapes. Colors are randomly generated (maximum of which can be defined).

// see readme file for options

SVG_GenerativeToons
======
Generative Painting (toons) is a branch of the original Generative Painting code. This generates compositions by pulling shapes from the database of .svg files, they are placed within the sketch at different locations and filled with predetermined colors (pulled from the simpsons).

// see readme file for options

SVG_VectorBend
======
This sketch loads a .SVG file as an XML document (formatting it as a string of characters) then finds and replaces random numbers throughout. It is then saved again as a .SVG, this works similar to the "find and replace" way of glitching a vector file with notepad for example. However by doing it this way, the handles at the start of the document are not affected - no file coruption!

Widmanstatten_Gen
======
Pattern Generator based on Widmanst√§tten patterns found commonly within meteroite fragments. [More info can be found here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widmanst%C3%A4tten_pattern)

Perlin_Blob
======
Blob generation based on Perlin Noise. Each iteration becomes more complex as the mouse is clicked.
