Generative Painting
======
Generative Painting is a way of algorithmically creating compositions for my acrylic paintings. This branch specifically is designed to look at the paths of vectors pulled from a database of shapes. It then places this path randomly (within limits) on the canvas. This then repeats though all the paths of all the shapes. Colors are randomly generated (maximum of which can be defined).

Generative Painting (toons)
======
Generative Painting (toons) is a branch of the original Generative Painting code. This generates compositions by pulling shapes from the database of .svg files, they are placed within the sketch at different locations and filled with perdetermined colors (pulled from the simpsons).
