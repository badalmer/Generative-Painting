# // Mariner 4

Iâ€™ve always been very interested in space. Growing up I would crawl libraries for interesting texts about the universe. Mostly for the artist renderings of far off worlds. When I first stumbled upon the Mariner 4 drawing done by the NASA/JPL team I found a connection to digital images and art that I never had put together before. This led me down the rabbit hole in terms of all this research. What better place to start than by reverse engineering what I believe the image compression was doing back in 1964.
